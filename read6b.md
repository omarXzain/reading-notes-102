# How Computers work
**Computers has diffrent parts with an input output and store all the information**
- computer is a programmable machine, It responds to a specific set of instructions in a well defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program)
- computers help us with thinking work like tracking stars in the sky or solving quizzing and too many things
- all computers inputs gives a computer informations and stored in the memory
- computers works on 101010101 system and and all electric wires and circuits inside the computer that carry the information 
- The binary system a base-2 number system, That means it only uses two numbers 0 and 1
- more complicated circuits can take multiple signals and combine them and give us a diffrent result
- examble how CPU works ... the CPU request step by step instructions from the memory which tell it how to draw anything
