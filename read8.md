# Operators and Loops
**it's about a decision making are made that determine which line of code should be run next**

## There are two components to a decision:
- An expression is evaluated which return a value
- A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation

# Comparision Operators:
By comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. the result will be a boolean: true or false
Exm:
- == means is equal too
 -!= means is not equal too
- === means strict equal too
- !== means to not equal too
- > means greater than 
- < less than 
- >= greater than or equal too
- <= less than or equal too

# Logical operators
**Comparision operators usually return single values of true or false and allow to co,pare the results of more than one comparison operator**

# IF Statements
**The F...else statement check a condition if it resolves to true or false** 

# Loop Condition
**loop is often used to loop through the items in an array like prompt the user and force him to put the right answer no matter tries he did, and it reapets until the condition return false**
## loop counter:
it uses a counter a condition and this instructs the code to run a specified number of times
